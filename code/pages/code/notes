<-- Callum Notes -->

# stats countup doesn't work on monitor - a better way to fire the function?

# grid header row expands on montor - find a way to set a cap to the row expansion without setting it grid-template-rows


- Look into aria labels and role attribute

- Use BEM properly

- Navigation switch from JS to CSS

- Look into accesabiltiy and semantic html (make sure using things like artical correctly)

- gracefull enhancment
